Bootstrap was the core technology used for this documentation project.

Indeed, I deconstructed the documentation on their site to build almost every element of this project from their code. Their documentation code wouldn't pass the Free Code Camp specifications on it's own. In order to pass the tests, I needed to deep dive into the code to find and adjust the various elements of padding and margin so that the code would pass.

I wish I had read the errors more closely as I was often looking in the wrong places to fix errors. For instance, I was often adjusting the distance of the nav-bar from the left of the page while the error was clearly telling me that the problem was the distance of the nav-bar from the top of the page.

## Thank You

Bootstrap made the technology, I just focused on rearranging it for a bit here:
